**To find project code, please see [FishShop.py](FishShop.py) file.**

<br /> 

**Pay attention, that you can set your desired sorting order and sorting key at the end of the program.**
``` python
    FishShop.sorting_reverse = True 
```
_**True**_ stands for a decreasing order sort, _**False**_ stands for an increasing order sort.
``` python
    FishShop.sorting_key = "name" 
```
Here, please enter what will be the sorting key.

<br /> 

> :warning: The only allowed values for **sorting_key** are **_name_**, **_price_** and **_weight_**. Otherwise, the program will raise **ValueError**.
